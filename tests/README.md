# Internship Work: Testing & Validation

During my internship at WVC, much of my initial work focused on testing and validating processes.

- Conducted spot checks to compare results across multiple stages of a workflow.
- Ensured consistency and accuracy throughout the process.
- Helped identify discrepancies early, improving the reliability and quality of the overall system.
