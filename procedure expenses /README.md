# Snowflake Stored Procedure: Daily Project Expense Table

I developed a stored procedure in Snowflake to create or update a table on a daily basis, consolidating project expense data into a single, easy-to-read view.

- The procedure generates a detailed table that combines information from multiple sources.  
- Provides month-by-month and year-to-date expense tracking.  
- Simplifies reporting and analysis, making it easier to answer budget and revenue questions.  
- Supports consistent, automated updates, reducing manual work and improving data reliability.
